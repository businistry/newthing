## Requirement Analysis

The project aims to create a passive income generating company, which requires a platform that can offer multiple income streams with minimal user intervention. The system should be scalable, user-friendly, and provide real-time analytics. It should cater to both beginners and advanced users, offering educational resources and customization options. The platform needs to balance automation with user control, ensuring high returns while minimizing operational costs.

## UI Design draft

The UI should feature a clean, modern design with a dashboard as the central hub. Key elements include:
